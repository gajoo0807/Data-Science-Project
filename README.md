# Data Science Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and report for a comprehensive data science project covering various topics such as classification, global optimization, and network compression.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into different directories, each focusing on a specific aspect of data science. Below is an overview of the main directories:

1. Frequent Pattern Analysis
* Analyzing frequent patterns in datasets to discover recurring combinations of items or events.
2. Classification
* The task of assigning predefined labels or categories to input data based on its characteristics.
3. Graph Classiciation
* Extending classification techniques to graph-structured data. The goal is to assign labels or categories to entire graphs or subgraphs.
4. Reinforcement Learning
* A machine learning paradigm where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or punishments.
5. Graph Adversarial Attack
* Investigating methods to perturb graph structures with the aim of misleading or compromising the performance of machine learning models trained on graphs.
6. Global Optimization
* Optimizing functions or finding optimal parameters on a global scale. Techniques include algorithms like Particle Swarm Optimization and Surrogate Models.
7. Network Compression
* Reducing the size and complexity of neural network models while preserving their functionality. Common methods include pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation.
8. Federated Learning
* A decentralized machine learning approach where models are trained across multiple devices or servers holding local data. The models are updated collaboratively without exchanging raw data.
